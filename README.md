Molecular graph representation learning plays a pivotal role in the advancement of modern drug discovery and material design.  It is often the case that molecular graphs are represented by 2D topological structures. However, recent insights reveal the critical role of 3D geometric data and functional groups in accurately predicting molecular functionalities, aspects often neglected in the existing molecular graph benchmark datasets. To bridge the research gap, we introduce the most comprehensive (to the best of our knowledge) molecular learning benchmark named 3D-FuM (function group motivated dataset for 3D Molecule learning), which incorporates both 3D topological information and functional groups of molecules. 3D-FuM integrates 18 state-of-the-art algorithms and 19 evaluation metrics on 3 molecular learning tasks. 3D-FuM, with novel angles and extensive experiments, enables researchers and practitioners to effectively and fairly evaluate newly proposed methods compared with existing baselines on varying types of datasets. Furthermore, we develop a visual analytic system for easy interaction on dataset and evaluation metrics selection, parameter adjustment, command generation, and leaderboard visualization. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark 3D-FuM and experimental results at https://3dfunctiongroupmoleculedataset.github.io/3D-FuM/#/Home.
